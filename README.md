## How It Works

The converter uses a two-step process:

1. **Convert to Decimal**: First, the input number is converted to decimal (base 10) by multiplying each digit by the base raised to its position power (positive for integer part, negative for fractional part)
2. **Convert to Target Base**: 
   - For the integer part: repeatedly divide by the target base and collect remainders (read bottom to top)
   - For the fractional part: repeatedly multiply by the target base and collect integer parts (read top to bottom)

## Browser Support

Works in all modern browsers:
- Chrome/Edge
